MorbidMeter is a perverse program that is intended to lend perspective
to one's life.

The program takes your date of birth, your estimated life-span,
today's date, and a unit of time (year, hour, minute, month, phase of
the moon, maybe others) and generates where (when?) you are right now
in that time unit.  Use a life expectancy calculator such as this one
(http://www.livingto100.com) to figure out how long you should live
(or just make up the number).

The gui part of MorbidMeter displays a clock/calendar/etc. that is
updated in realtime (albeit slowly --thank goodness) to remind you
that nothing lasts forever.  Not even you.

Bugs: Right now MorbidMeter does not store user data between sessions,
and has no fancy graphics.  However, the simple gui does work.  Try

./mm --gui

in Linux or

python mm.py --gui

in Windows.

The default timescale is one year.  Set the timescale with the -t
switch, e.g.

./mm --gui -t day

Supported timescales so far are year, day, and hour.  Add the --msec
switch to display milliseconds (if you really want to be depressed --
they go by fairly quickly).
