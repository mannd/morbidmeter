MorbidMeter is a perverse program that is intended to lend perspective
to one's life.

The program takes your date of birth, your estimated life-span,
today's date, and a unit of time (year, hour, minute, month, phase of
the moon, maybe others) and generates where (when?) you are right now
in that time unit.

The gui part of MorbidMeter will display a
clock/calendar/etc. that will updated in realtime (albeit slowly
--thank goodness) to remind you that nothing lasts forever.  Not even
you.

Bugs:  Right now MorbidMeter only uses a single year timescale, does
not store user data between sessions, and displays error messages when
terminating.  However, the simple gui works.  Try

./mm --gui 

or 

./mm --gui --msec

in Linux or

python mm.py --gui 

or 

python mm.py --gui --msec

in Windows.
