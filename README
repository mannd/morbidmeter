MorbidMeter is a perverse program that is intended to lend perspective
to one's life.

The program takes your date of birth, your estimated life-span,
today's date, and a unit of time (year, hour, minute, month, phase of
the moon, maybe others) and generates where (when?) you are right now
in that time unit.  Use a life expectancy calculator such as this one
(http://www.livingto100.com) to figure out how long you should live
(or just make up the number).

The gui part of MorbidMeter displays a clock/calendar/etc. that is
updated in realtime (albeit slowly --thank goodness) to remind you
that nothing lasts forever.  Not even you.

Bugs: Right now MorbidMeter has no fancy graphics.  However, the
simple gui does work.  Try

./mm --gui

in Linux or

python mm.py --gui

in Windows.

The default timescale is one year.  Set the timescale with the -t
switch, e.g.

./mm --gui -t day

Supported timescales so far are year, month, day, and hour.  Add the --msec
switch to display milliseconds (if you really want to be depressed -- they go
by fairly quickly).  Additional non-date-based timescales available are
universe (the age of the universe from Big Bang to present, set at 15 billion
years), age (your age in days) and percent (percent of your life already
lived).

MorbidMeter can display a reverse timescale (counting down to 0) by adding the
--reverse switch.  

Try the --help switch for a complete list of command line options.

MorbidMeter remembers user data between invocations.  Add the --reset
switch to change user data, e.g. ./mm --gui --reset.
