MorbidMeter is a perverse program that is intended to lend perspective to one's life.

The program takes your date of birth, your estimated life-span, today's date, and a unit of time (year, hour, minute, month, phase of the moon, maybe others) and generates where (when?) you are right now in that time unit.  

The anticipated gui part of MorbidMeter will display a clock/calendar/etc. that will updated in realtime (albeit slowly --thank goodness) to remind you that nothing lasts forever.  Not even you.
