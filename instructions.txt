- Installation
  - Requires Python on your system.
  - Python should be present already if you run Linux or Mac OS X.
  - Windows users will probably have to download Python: 
    - http://www.python.org/download/
  - Python version should be 2.x, do not use the 3.x version.
- Starting the program
  - Linux or Mac OS X
    - from the command line type
      ./mm
  - Windows
    - in a DOS command box type
      python mm.py
    - optionally create a shortcut to MorbidMeter, you can use the
      included skull icon for your shortcut.
  - You will want to include some command options described below.
- Command line options
  - -i or --interactive runs MorbidMeter on the command line without a gui.
  - --gui sends the output to a small window on your desktop.
  - --msec adds milliseconds to the output.
  - -t or --timescale sets the timescale used.  The current
    timescales are:
    - year
    - day
    - hour
    - month
    - universe
    - reverseuniverse
    - percent
    For example, python mm.py -t year or python mm.py --timescale=day
    will set the timescale to a day.  Default timescale is a year.
  - --interval sets the update interval in milliseconds.  Default is
    1000 msec (= 1 sec).  E.g. python mm.py --interval=2000 sets the
    update interval to 2 sec.
  - --reset asks for new user data.  Otherwise MorbidMeter reuses the
    last set of user data.
- Timescales
  - year: life is compressed to a single year.
  - day: life is compressed to 24 hours.
  - hour: life is compressed to a single hour.
  - month: life is compressed to the month of January.
  - universe: life is expanded from the Big Bang to present (15 billion years).
  - reverseuniverse: like above only counting down the years.
  - percent: what percentage of your life is gone.
- Examples
  - First time usage
    python mm.py will prompt you to rerun with either the --gui or
    --interactive command switch.  The first time you run MorbidMeter
    you should use:
    python mm.py --gui or python mm.py --interactive
  - Select timescale
    The default timescale is a year, you don't have to do anything
    special to use the year timescale.  For the other timescales, use
    the timescale switch, e.g.:
    python mm.py --gui --timescale=day
  - Entering birthdate and longevity information.  
    Try the website (http://www.livingto100.com) to figure out how
    long you should live. Follow the prompts to do this.
  - Subsequent usage
    rerunning mm.py will reuse the date information already entered.
    You will still need to repeat the --gui and/or --timescale
    switches on the command line each time your start the
    program. E.g.:
    python mm.py --gui
  - Resetting birthdate and longevity information.
    use python mm.py --reset --gui to restart the gui version with new
    birth and death information.
